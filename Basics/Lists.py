# when to use lists or arrays
"""
Because of the way that lists are implemented, elements can be appended to them very efficiently. 
If you want your collection to grow and shrink in a time-efficient manner, then lists should be used. 
Itâ€™s also better to use lists if you need to manage lots of different data types, however, arrays are better when 
you need to store a lot of data and perform a large number of computationally intensive mathematical operations. 
Note that the arrays from the NumPy library of Python are better suited for mathematical use cases.
