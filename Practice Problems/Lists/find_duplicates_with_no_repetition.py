Given a list of integers, find all the duplicates that exist in that list.

Input
    A list of duplicate integers
Output
    A list with the duplicates if they exist, and an empty list if they donâ€™t
Sample Input
    lst = [1, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 7, 7]
Sample Output
    result = [1, 3, 7]

While traversing, the element is made the key of the dictionary and its value is set to 1. 
If the element occurs again in the list, the value corresponding to the dictionary key (which has that element) is 
updated and the element is put in the list. This continues until the list is fully traversed. 
In the end, the list is returned with all the elements that have duplicate entries
