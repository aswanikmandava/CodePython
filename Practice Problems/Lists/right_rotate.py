# Implement a function right_rotate(lst, k) which will rotate the given list by k. 
# This means that the right-most elements will appear at the left-most position in the list and so on. 
# You only have to rotate the list by one element at a time.

# Rotate by 3 elements
# Input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Output: [30, 40, 50, 10, 20]

# time complexity: O(n)
